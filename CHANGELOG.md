# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project plan for ERAP Map PoC: project brief, architecture, data contract
  skeleton and milestones in `docs/design/`, and ADRs 0002 to 0004 for the
  pipeline, web app, and Docker Compose stack choices.
- ADR 0005: CARTO Positron and Dark Matter basemaps, with the API key
  supplied at runtime; `.env.example` documents `CARTO_API_KEY`.
- CI: `changes` job so docs-only PRs skip stack jobs, a single required
  `checks` job, a commented cache example, and an opt-in `warm-cache.yml`.
- Hints in `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore` and the handoff
  template.
- Initial project harness: issue and PR templates, contribution and security
  policies, docs structure (design, decisions, handoffs), and Claude Code
  working rules.

### Changed

- ADR 0001 names files `NNNN-short-title.md`, matching the ADR README.
- `ci.yml` runs on pull requests only; `bootstrap-repo-settings.sh` gates on
  `checks` by default.
